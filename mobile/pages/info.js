    <h1>The Dog & His Reflection</h1>
    <p>A Dog, to whom the butcher had thrown a bone, was hurrying home with his prize as fast as he could go. As he crossed a narrow footbridge, he happened to look down and saw himself reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror. But the greedy Dog thought he saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own.</p>
    <p>If he had stopped to think he would have known better. But instead of thinking, he dropped his bone and sprang at the Dog in the river, only to find himself swimming for dear life to reach the shore. At last he managed to scramble out, and as he stood sadly thinking about the good bone he had lost, he realized what a stupid Dog he had been.</p>
    <p>It is very foolish to be greedy.</p>
    <h2>Belling the Cat</h2>
    <p>Long ago, the mice had a general council to consider what measures they could take to outwit their common enemy, the Cat.</p>
    <p><i>&quot;You will all agree,&quot;</i> said he, <i>&quot;that our chief danger consists in the sly and treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us. Now, if we could receive some signal of her approach, we could easily escape from her. I venture, therefore, to propose that a small bell be procured, and attached by a ribbon round the neck of the Cat. By this means we should always know when she was about, and could easily retire while she was in the neighbourhood.&quot;</i></p>
    <p>This proposal met with general applause, until an old mouse got up and said:</p>
    <p><i>&quot;That is all very well, but who is to bell the Cat?&quot;</i></p>
    <p>The mice looked at one another and nobody spoke. Then the old mouse said:</p>
    <p><i>&quot;It is easy to propose impossible remedies.&quot;</i></p>
