[Ping It To](https://pingit.to) allows you to send URLs between a mobile and desktop device using QR codes. There is no need for an account and no unnecessary bells and whistles.

We also include useful features including a search bar and clock, and also a stunning background image so Ping It To can function as a great start page/new tab page replacement.

## About the Creator

Hi, I'm [Alistair Shepherd](https://alistairshepherd.uk), a frontend web developer from the Highlands of Scotland and currently living in Edinburgh.

I built Ping It To as I have used similar QR-based URL sharing solutions for a couple of years and none have been quite what I wanted from them. Between them they suffered from reliability problems, lack of SSL security, slow load times, poor apps and also required a fair chunk of userscripts and userstyles to look good enough to be my 'new tab' page.

Ping It To aims to fix all of those problems.

## How to Use

### Mobile to Desktop

1. Visit the [Mobile Website](https://m.pingit.to) on your smartphone in Google Chrome on Android or Safari on iOS.
2. Install the app by tapping "Add to Home Screen". On Chrome this is in the three dots in the top-right corner, and for Safari tap the "Share" button.
3. On other apps, select "Share" and choose Ping It To
4. Ensure "RECEIVE" is selected on the left and a QR Code is visible
5. Scan the QR Code on your mobile device. You'll then be redirected to the link you shared

You can also directly insert links within the mobile app instead of sharing them from another app.

### Desktop to Mobile

1. Click "SEND" on the left and type/paste the link into the input that appears
2. Scan the QR Code shown on your moble device with the Ping It To mobile app (installation instructions above)
3. You can also use any other QR Code reader should you prefer using an alternate app.

### Browser extensions

To provide a better new tab replacement Ping It To is also available as a Chrome or Firefox extension, distributed on Github. To find these and their installation instructions go to [Releases](https://github.com/Accudio/pingit.to/releases).
